# California Highway Collision Analysis

An analysis into the rates of collisions on California Highways performed during my time in the Insight Data Science fellowship program (Summer 2017).
By combining the traffic flow rates from the Caltrans Traffic Program with the accident reports of Statewide Integrated Traffic Response System (SWITRS) from the California Highway Patrol (CHP), I identified locations with higher than expected collision rates.


## Outline

To follow along the steps of the analysis, the Jupyter notebooks should be explored in the following order:
1. AADT
2. SWITRS
3. Mapping (optional)
4. Features
5. Clustering


## Authors

Unless otherwise noted, all work contained on this page was performed by me, Andy Julin.


## Acknowledgements

An excellent package for processing the SWITRS data is found at (SWITRS-to-SQLite)[https://github.com/agude/SWITRS-to-SQLite/].  The author, Alex Gude, was also the initial inspiration for looking into this dataset.
